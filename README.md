Welcome to the laboratory course at KE0066, academic year 2019-20   Before the first lab session, it is mandatory for each student to read through the safety regulations, see menu on the left     Get well prepared for the labs and read the tutorial carefully in advance.   For lab 2, each student should include:  1. Soil for determination of pH (500 grams) Sampling takes place according to the Swedish Agricultural Agency's standard, is available on the course's Canvas page and is reviewed during lecture. Specify the coordinates (SWEREF 99) for the sampling. NOTE! The soil samples must be dried at least one week at room temperature before use.    2. Water for determination of hardness (at least 500 ml) The water should be taken directly from a well or as close to a well as possible. If the water has passed through copper pipes, copper ions may have been released, which affects the analysis results. Specify the coordinates (SWEREF 99) for the sampling.
